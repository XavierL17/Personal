MusicRipper is designed to download music to your computer. Currently only supports Youtube Music playlists. To use adjust mouse coordinates as my resolution may differ from yours. It uses the accessibility tab of inspect (f12) on google chrome. It scraps the metadata and saves an mp3 of the song with all relavent tags.
